In this model class, uncertainty about separate weights in each layer produces dynamics that follow a stochastic differential equation (SDE). We demonstrate gradient-based stochastic variational inference in this infinite-parameter setting, producing arbitrarily-flexible approximate posteriors. We also derive a novel gradient estimator that approaches zero variance as the approximate posterior approaches the true posterior. This approach inherits the memory-efficient training and tunable precision of neural ODEs.\nWinnie Xu, Ricky Tian Qi Chen, Xuechen Li, David Duvenaud\nArtificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2022.\npaper | code | slides | bibtex\nComplex Momentum for Learning in Games\nWe generalize gradient descent with momentum for learning in differentiable games to have complex-valued momentum. We give theoretical motivation for our method by proving convergence on bilinear zero-sum games for simultaneous and alternating updates. Our method gives real-valued parameter updates, making it a drop-in replacement for standard optimizers. We empirically demonstrate that complex-valued momentum can improve convergence in adversarial games-like generative adversarial networks-by showing we can find better solutions with an almost identical computational cost. We also show a practical generalization to a complex-valued Adam variant, which we use to train BigGAN to better inception scores on CIFAR-10.\nJonathan Lorraine, Paul Vicol, David Acuna, David Duvenaud\nArtificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2022.\npaper | slides | bibtex\nMeta-Learning to Improve Pre-Training\nPre-training large models is useful, but adds many hyperparameters, such as task weights or augmentations in SimCLR. We give a scalable, gradient-based way to tune these hyperparamters. Because exact pre-training gradients are intractable, we approximate them. Specifically, we compose implicit differentiation for the long, almost-converged pre-training stage, with backprop through training for the short fine-tuning stage. We applied approximate pre-training gradients to tune thousands of task weights for graph-based protein function prediction, and to learn an entire data augmentation neural net for contrastive learning on electrocardiograms.\nAniruddh Raghu, Jonathan Lorraine, Simon Kornblith, Matthew McDermott, David Duvenaud\nNeural Information Processing Systems, 2021\npaper | bibtex\nGetting to the Point: Index Sets and Parallelism-Preserving Autodiff for Pointful Array Programming\nWe attempt to combine the clarity and safety of high-level functional languages with the efficiency and parallelism of low-level numerical languages. We treat arrays as eagerly-memoized functions on typed index sets, allowing abstract function manipulations, such as currying, to work on arrays. In contrast to composing primitive bulk-array operations, we argue for an explicit nested indexing style that mirrors application of functions to arguments. We also introduce a fine-grained typed effects system which affords concise and automatically-parallelized in-place updates.\nAdam Paszke, Daniel D.

Our approach uses gradients of the likelihood function with respect to its discrete inputs to propose updates in a Metropolis-Hastings sampler. We show empirically that this approach outperforms generic samplers in a number of difficult settings including Ising models, Potts models, restricted Boltzmann machines, and factorial hidden Markov models. We also demonstrate the use of our improved sampler for training deep energy-based models on high dimensional discrete data. This approach outperforms variational auto-encoders and existing energy-based models. Finally, we give bounds showing that our approach is near-optimal in the class of samplers which propose local updates.\nWill Grathwohl, Milad Hashemi, Kevin Swersky, David Duvenaud, Chris Maddison\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2021.

In this work, we present a simple method for training EBMs at scale which uses an entropy-regularized generator to amortize the MCMC sampling typically used in EBM training. We apply our estimator to the recently proposed Joint Energy Model (JEM), where we match the original performance with faster and stable training. This allows us to extend JEM models to semi-supervised classification on tabular data from a variety of continuous domains.\nWill Grathwohl*, Jacob Kelly*, Milad Hashemi, Mohammad Norouzi, Kevin Swersky, David Duvenaud\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2021\npaper | code | bibtex\nSelf-Tuning Stochastic Optimization with Curvature-Aware Gradient Filtering\nWe explore the use of exact per-sample Hessian-vector products and gradients to construct optimizers that are self-tuning and hyperparameter-free. Based on a dynamical model, we derive a curvature-corrected, noise-adaptive online gradient estimate. We prove that our model-based procedure converges in the noisy quadratic setting. Though we do not see similar gains in deep learning tasks, we match the performance of well-tuned optimizers. Our initial experiments indicate that when training deep nets our optimizer works too well, in a sense - it descends into regions of high variance and high curvature early on in the optimization, and gets stuck there.\nRicky Tian Qi Chen, Dami Choi, Lukas Balles, David Duvenaud, Philipp Hennig\nNeurIPS Workshop on \"I Can't Believe It's Not Better!\", 2020\npaper | slides | talk | bibtex\nLearning Differential Equations that are Easy to Solve\nNeural ODEs become expensive to solve numerically as training progresses. We introduce a differentiable surrogate for the time cost of standard numerical solvers using higher-order derivatives of solution trajectories. These derivatives are efficient to compute with Taylor-mode automatic differentiation. Optimizing this additional objective trades model performance against the time cost of solving the learned dynamics.\nJacob Kelly*, Jesse Bettencourt*, Matthew Johnson, David Duvenaud\nNeural Information Processing Systems, 2020.\npaper | code | bibtex\nScalable Gradients for Stochastic Differential Equations\nWe generalize the adjoint sensitivity method to stochastic differential equations, allowing time-efficient and constant-memory computation of gradients with high-order adaptive solvers. Specifically, we derive a stochastic differential equation whose solution is the gradient, a memory-efficient algorithm for caching noise, and conditions under which numerical solutions converge. In addition, we combine our method with gradient-based stochastic variational inference for latent stochastic differential equations. We use our method to fit stochastic dynamics defined by neural networks, achieving competitive performance on a 50-dimensional motion capture dataset.\nXuechen Li, Ting-Kam Leonard Wong, Ricky Tian Qi Chen, David Duvenaud\nArtificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2020.\npaper | code | slides | talk | bibtex\nOptimizing Millions of Hyperparameters by Implicit Differentiation\nWe use the implicit function theorem to scalably approximate gradients of the validation loss with respect to hyperparameters. This lets us train networks with millions of weights and millions of hyperparameters. For instance, we learn a data-augmentation network - where every weight is a hyperparameter tuned for validation performance - that outputs augmented training examples, from scratch. We also learn a distilled dataset where each feature in each datapoint is a hyperparameter, and tune millions of regularization hyperparameters.\nJonathan Lorraine, Paul Vicol, David Duvenaud\nArtificial Intelligence and Statistics, 2020.\npaper | slides | bibtex\nYour Classifier is Secretly an Energy Based Model and You Should Treat it Like One\nWe show that you can reinterpret standard classification architectures as energy-based generative models and train them as such. Doing this allows us to achieve state-of-the-art performance at both generative and discriminative modeling in a single model. Adding this energy-based training also improves calibration, out-of-distribution detection, and adversarial robustness.\nWill Grathwohl, Kuan-Chieh Wang, Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen, David Duvenaud, Mohammad Norouzi, Kevin Swersky\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2020.\npaper | code | video poster | bibtex\nSUMO: Unbiased Estimation of Log Marginal Probability for Latent Variable Models\nWe introduce an unbiased estimator of the log marginal likelihood and its gradients for latent variable models.

We use graph neural networks to generate new edges conditioned on the already-sampled parts of the graph, reducing dependence on node ordering and bypasses the bottleneck caused by the sequential nature of RNNs. We achieve state-of-the-art time efficiency and sample quality compared to previous models, and generate graphs of up to 5000 nodes.\nRenjie Liao, Yujia Li, Yang Song, Shenlong Wang, Charlie Nash, William L.

We generalize RNNs to have continuous-time hidden dynamics defined by ordinary differential equations. These models can naturally handle arbitrary time gaps between observations, and can explicitly model the probability of observation times using Poisson processes.\nYulia Rubanova, Ricky Tian Qi Chen, David Duvenaud\nNeural Information Processing Systems, 2019.\npaper | code | bibtex\nResidual Flows for Invertible Generative Modeling\nInvertible residual networks provide transformations where only Lipschitz conditions rather than architectural constraints are needed for enforcing invertibility. We give a tractable unbiased estimate of the log density, and improve these models in other ways. The resulting approach, called Residual Flows, achieves state-of-the-art performance on density estimation amongst flow-based models.\nRicky Tian Qi Chen, Jens Behrmann, David Duvenaud, Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen\nNeural Information Processing Systems, 2019.\npaper | code | slides | bibtex\nInvertible Residual Networks\nWe show that standard ResNet architectures can be made invertible, allowing the same model to be used for classification, density estimation, and generation. Our approach only requires adding a simple normalization step during training. Invertible ResNets define a generative model which can be trained by maximum likelihood on unlabeled data. To compute likelihoods, we introduce a tractable approximation to the Jacobian log-determinant of a residual block. Our empirical evaluation shows that invertible ResNets perform competitively with both stateof-the-art image classifiers and flow-based generative models, something that has not been previously achieved with a single architecture.\nJens Behrmann, Will Grathwohl, Ricky Tian Qi Chen, David Duvenaud, Jörn-Henrik Jacobsen\nInternational Conference on Machine Learning, 2019.\npaper | code | slides | bibtex\nSelf-Tuning Networks: Bilevel Optimization of Hyperparameters using Structured Best-Response Functions\nHyperparameter optimization can be formulated as a bilevel optimization problem, where the optimal parameters on the training set depend on the hyperparameters. We adapt regularization hyperparameters for neural networks by fitting compact approximations to the best-response function, which maps hyperparameters to optimal weights and biases. We show how to construct scalable best-response approximations for neural networks by modeling the best-response as a single network whose hidden units are gated conditionally on the regularizer.\nMatthew MacKay, Paul Vicol, Jonathan Lorraine, David Duvenaud, Roger Grosse\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.\npaper | code | slides | bibtex\nFFJORD: Free-form Continuous Dynamics for Scalable Reversible Generative Models\nTraining normalized generative models such as Real NVP or Glow requires restricting their architectures to allow cheap computation of Jacobian determinants. Alternatively, if the transformation is specified by an ordinary differential equation, then the Jacobian's trace can be used. We use Hutchinson's trace estimator to give a scalable unbiased estimate of the log-density. The result is a continuous-time invertible generative model with unbiased density estimation and one-pass sampling, while allowing unrestricted neural network architectures. We demonstrate our approach on high-dimensional density estimation, image generation, and variational inference, improving the state-of-the-art among exact likelihood methods with efficient sampling.\nWill Grathwohl, Ricky Tian Qi Chen, Jesse Bettencourt, Ilya Sutskever, David Duvenaud\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2019. Oral presentation.\npaper | slides | code | bibtex\nExplaining Image Classifiers by Counterfactual Generation\nWhen an image classifier makes a prediction, which parts of the image are relevant and why? We can rephrase this question to ask: which parts of the image, if they were not seen by the classifier, would most change its decision? Producing an answer requires marginalizing over images that could have been seen but weren't. We can sample plausible image in-fills by conditioning a generative model on the rest of the image. We then optimize to find the image regions that most change the classifier's decision after in-fill. Our approach contrasts with ad-hoc in-filling approaches, such as blurring or injecting noise, which generate inputs far from the data distribution, and ignore informative relationships between different parts of the image. Our method produces more compact and relevant saliency maps, with fewer artifacts compared to previous methods.\nChun-Hao Chang, Elliot Creager, Anna Goldenberg, David Duvenaud\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2019.\npaper | code | slides | bibtex\nStochastic Hyperparameter Optimization Through Hypernetworks\nModels are usually tuned by nesting optimization of model weights inside the optimization of hyperparameters. We collapse this nested optimization into joint stochastic optimization of weights and hyperparameters. Our method trains a neural net to output approximately optimal weights as a function of hyperparameters. This method converges to locally optimal weights and hyperparameters for sufficiently large hypernetworks. We compare this method to standard hyperparameter optimization strategies and demonstrate its effectiveness for tuning thousands of hyperparameters.\nJonathan Lorraine, David Duvenaud\npaper | bibtex | slides | code\nNeural Ordinary Differential Equations\nWe introduce a new family of deep neural network models. Instead of specifying a discrete sequence of hidden layers, we parameterize the derivative of the hidden state using a neural network. The output of the network is computed using a black-box differential equation solver. These continuous-depth models have constant memory cost, adapt their evaluation strategy to each input, and can explicitly trade numerical precision for speed. We demonstrate these properties in continuous-depth residual networks and continuous-time latent variable models. We also construct continuous normalizing flows, a generative model that can train by maximum likelihood, without partitioning or ordering the data dimensions. For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.\nRicky Tian Qi Chen, Yulia Rubanova, Jesse Bettencourt, David Duvenaud\nNeural Information Processing Systems, 2018.

However, existing regularization schemes also hurt the model's ability to model the data. We show a simple method to regularize only the part that causes disentanglement. We also give a principled, classifier-free measure of disentanglement called the mutual information gap.\nRicky Tian Qi Chen, Xuechen Li, Roger Grosse, David Duvenaud\nNeural Information Processing Systems, 2018.

We show that natural gradient ascent with adaptive weight noise implicitly fits a variational Gassuain posterior. This insight allows us to train full-covariance, fully factorized, or matrix-variate Gaussian variational posteriors using noisy versions of natural gradient, Adam, and K-FAC, respectively, allowing us to scale to modern-size convnets. Our noisy K-FAC algorithm makes better predictions and has better-calibrated uncertainty than existing methods. This leads to more efficient exploration in active learning and reinforcement learning.\nGuodong Zhang, Shengyang Sun, David Duvenaud, Roger Grosse\nInternational Conference on Machine Learning, 2018\npaper | bibtex | video | code\nInference Suboptimality in Variational Autoencoders\nAmortized inference allows latent-variable models to scale to large datasets. The quality of approximate inference is determined by two factors: a) the capacity of the variational distribution to match the true posterior and b) the ability of the recognition net to produce good variational parameters for each datapoint. We show that the recognition net giving bad variational parameters is often a bigger problem than using a Gaussian approximate posterior, because the generator can adapt to it.\nChris Cremer, Xuechen Li, David Duvenaud\nInternational Conference on Machine Learning, 2018\npaper | bibtex | slides\nBackpropagation through the Void: Optimizing control variates for black-box gradient estimation\nWe learn low-variance, unbiased gradient estimators for any function of random variables. We backprop through a neural net surrogate of the original function, which is optimized to minimize gradient variance during the optimization of the original objective. We train discrete latent-variable models, and do continuous and discrete reinforcement learning with an adaptive, action-conditional baseline.\nWill Grathwohl, Dami Choi, Yuhuai Wu, Geoff Roeder, David Duvenaud\nInternational Conference on Learning Representations, 2018\npaper | code | slides | bibtex\nAutomatic chemical design using a data-driven continuous representation of molecules\nWe develop a molecular autoencoder, which converts discrete representations of molecules to and from a continuous representation. This allows gradient-based optimization through the space of chemical compounds. Continuous representations also let us generate novel chemicals by interpolating between molecules.\nRafa Gómez-Bombarelli, Jennifer Wei, David Duvenaud, José Miguel Hernández-Lobato, Benjamín Sánchez-Lengeling, Sheberla, Dennis, Jorge Aguilera-Iparraguirre, Timothy Hirzel, Ryan P. Adams, Alán Aspuru-Guzik\nAmerican Chemical Society Central Science, 2018\npaper | bibtex | slides | code\nSticking the landing: Simple, lower-variance gradient estimators for variational inference\nWe give a simple recipe for reducing the variance of the gradient of the variational evidence lower bound. The entire trick is just removing one term from the gradient. Removing this term leaves an unbiased gradient estimator whose variance approaches zero as the approximate posterior approaches the exact posterior. We also generalize this trick to mixtures and importance-weighted posteriors.\nGeoff Roeder, Yuhuai Wu, David Duvenaud\nNeural Information Processing Systems, 2017\npaper | bibtex | code\nReinterpreting importance-weighted autoencoders\nThe standard interpretation of importance-weighted autoencoders is that they maximize a tighter, multi-sample lower bound than the standard evidence lower bound. We give an alternate interpretation: it optimizes the standard lower bound, but using a more complex distribution, which we show how to visualize.\nChris Cremer, Quaid Morris, David Duvenaud\nICLR Workshop track, 2017\npaper | bibtex\nComposing graphical models with neural networks for structured representations and fast inference\nWe propose a general modeling and inference framework that combines the complementary strengths of probabilistic graphical models and deep learning methods. Our model family composes latent graphical models with neural network observation likelihoods. All components are trained simultaneously. We use this framework to automatically segment and categorize mouse behavior from raw depth video.\nMatthew Johnson, David Duvenaud, Alex Wiltschko, Bob Datta, Ryan P.

We propose that humans use compositionality: complex structure is decomposed into simpler building blocks. We formalize this idea using a grammar over Gaussian process kernels. We show that people prefer compositional extrapolations, and argue that this is consistent with broad principles of human cognition.\nEric Shulz, Joshua B.

It can handle loops, ifs, recursion and closures, and it can even take derivatives of its own derivatives. It uses reverse-mode differentiation (a.k.a. backpropagation), which means it's efficient for gradient-based optimization.

This Bayesian interpretation of SGD gives a theoretical foundation for popular tricks such as early stopping and ensembling.

Easterbrook (2014). Open code for open science?

Some of this work focusses on the idea of Systems Thinking as a key strategy in understanding. See for example:\nS. M.

Proceedings, 37th ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering, Florence, Italy, 16-24 May, 2015.\nMy earlier work focussed on systems analysis for complex software-intensive systems, particularly questions such as how the views of different stakeholders can be compared and merged; the role of modelling for understanding and communicating key ideas about systems; software verification and validation and how it affects software quality; and the social and cognitive processes that support coordination within teams of software developers. I'm also interested in the broader question of how software development re-shapes human activities, or more accurately, how human activities and software systems co-evolve, each shaping the other in important ways.

It is not, however, focused on being a collection of algorithms or only providing high-level intuition. Instead, it tries to build the mathematical intuition behind many important ideas and concepts often encountered in RL. We prove many basic, or sometimes not so basic, results in RL.

I am also a Member of Technical Staff on the Alignment Team at Anthropic through the summer of 2024.\nMy research has focused on better understanding neural net training dynamics, and using this understanding to improve training speed, generalization, uncertainty estimation, and automatic hyperparameter tuning. I’m now focusing on applying our understanding of deep learning to AI alignment. Given how fast AI is progressing, the problem of ensuring AIs are robustly aligned with human values seems like the most important thing we can be working on now. Specific directions I’m interested in include:\nGiven a surprising behavior from an AI system, how can we efficiently figure out which training examples were responsible (so that we can then investigate the detailed mechanisms)?\nWhen do neural nets learn mesa-optimizers, i.e. when is the forward pass doing some sort of optimization without us building it in? Do such cases lead to different generalization patterns? How can we detect this, reverse engineer the inner objective function, and/or prevent it from happening?\nHow can we elicit reliable information from models we don’t fully trust?\nI hold a Sloan Fellowship, Canada Research Chair, and Canada CIFAR AI Chair. Previously, I received my BS in symbolic systems from Stanford in 2008, my MS in computer science from Stanford in 2009, and my PhD in computer science from MIT in 2014, studying under Bill Freeman and Josh Tenenbaum. From 2014-2016, I was a postdoc at the University of Toronto, working with Ruslan Salakhutdinov.

He is also a Senior Research Scientist at Adobe Research, Toronto. Before his post‑doc at Columbia University, he received a PhD in Computer Science from ETH Zurich advised by Prof. Olga Sorkine‑Hornung, and an MA and BA in Computer Science and Mathematics from the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences, New York University. His work spans all aspects of geometry processing, including machine learning for 2D/3D geometry, physics-based simulation, computational fabrication, numerical methods for geometric energies and PDEs, and interactive design tools for 2D and 3D. He has published several papers in the proceedings of ACM SIGGRAPH. He leads development of the widely used geometry processing library, libigl, winner of the 2015 SGP software award. In 2020, he received the ACM SIGGRAPH Significant New Researcher Award. In 2022, he received a Sloan Research Fellowship. In 2023, he received an Outstanding Teaching Award and a CS-Can/Info-Can Outstanding Early Career Computer Science Research Award.\nAcknowledgments\nOur research is funded in part by NSERC Discovery (RGPIN–2022–04680), the Ontario Early Research Award program, the Canada Research Chairs Program, a Sloan Research Fellowship, the DSI Catalyst Grant program and gifts by Adobe Inc.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nThese are some questions that I receive fairly regularly in cold-call emails.\nWill you hire me as a PhD Student?\nMaybe! The first step is to apply directly to the graduate program of the Department of Computer Science or Department of Mathematics. Our regular deadline is in December for students applying to start in the following Fall. Our program is very competitive. Most students put months of effort into their application package. Your research interests should match or harmonize with mine (see publications above for an idea). You should not only mention this in your application (and mention me by name), but also write about how and why we’re a great match. If you’d like to chat about research or life at dgp as a graduate student, feel free to contact me.\nWill you hire me as a postdoc?\nMaybe! Postdoc positions are very limited. If I’m not already aware of your research then chances are much smaller. In any case, contact me to begin the conversation. Have a one-to-two year research agenda prepared.\nIn nearly all circumstances, I will ask you to apply for a postdoc fellowship (and I will help you apply). Please review relevant fellowships, including those specifically for Canadian permanent residences (if applicable) or “mobility” fellowships from your home country/country of PhD.\nI’m an undergrad from University of Toronto, could I work as your research assistant?\nMaybe! Undergraduate research assistantships are limited and competitive. You should be a proficient programmer and feel confident in Calculus and Linear Algebra. If you haven’t already, sign up for the undergraduate Computer Graphics course and my graduate-level Geometry Processing course (and probably also David Levin’s Computational Fabrication and Kyros Kutulakus’s Foundations of Computational Vision courses). Good performance in these courses will put you at a great advantage. Also, start attending the dgp graphics reading group and the dgp graphics seminar talks. If you’re hoping to work with me over the summer, reach out to me around January/February. Give an indication of what research of mine most interests you and what sort of way you could imagine yourself contributing (in practice, we will try to find a current project to match you with, but this information will help).\nI’m an undergrad from X ≠ Unversity of Toronto, could I work as a your research assistant?\nMaybe! External undergraduate research assistantships are even more limited than internal ones. If you can secure or apply for funding from your home institution or country then you will be at a great advantage. If you do not already have a funding source, then before contacting me investigate whether fellowships for exchange programs etc. exist in your institution/country. If there are none, then consider applying to one of the summer undergraduate research fellowship programs at University of Toronto (e.g., at the Fields Institute). Finally, if you still cannot find funding, contact me with an application including a statement of purpose, faculty references, (unofficial) transcripts, and resume."

My main research interest is in using new simulation techniques to allow artists, engineers and scientists to study and create -- everything from animations to machines. Currently I pursue this goal as an Assistant Professor at the University of Toronto. I've also spent time as an Associate Research Scientist at Disney Research and a postdoc with Prof. Wojciech Matusik at MIT. Before my tenure in Boston, MA I studied Sensorimotor computation under Dinesh K.

   "text": "Fan Long\nHome\nAbout\nNews\nResearch\nPublications\nFan Long\nAssistant Professor\nDepartment of Computer Science, University of Toronto Bahen Centre for Information Technology, BA3250\n416-978-6055\nfanl at cs dot toronto dot edu\nAbout\nMy research interests are programming language, software engineering, systems security, and blockchain. I am involved in the Conflux project for building the next generation blockchain platform.\nUseful Links: Google Scholar page, and Automatic Patch Generation project website.\nNews\nI moved replication packages and experimental data to U of T server for for automatic patch generation via learning (Genesis, Prophet, and SPR).\nWelcome to my new homepage! My old homepage at MIT CSAIL is no longer maintained.\nResearch Projects\nBlockchain Scalability\nFollowing the success of the cryptocurrencies, blockchain has recently evolved into a technology platform that powers secure, decentralized, and consistent transaction ledgers at Internet-scale. However, the performance bottleneck remains one of the most critical challenges of current blockchains. In the standard Nakamoto consensus, the performance is bottlenecked by the facts 1) that only one participant can win the competition and contribute to the blockchain, i.e., concurrent blocks are discarded as forks, and 2) that the slowness is essential to defend against adversaries. For example, Bitcoin generates one 1MB block every 10 minutes and can therefore only process 7 transactions per second. The insufficient throughput and long confirmation delay severely limit the adoptions of blockchain techniques, causing poor user experience, congested network, and skyrocketing transaction fees.\nConflux: Conflux is a new fast, scalable, and decentralized blockchain system that can process thousands of transactions per second while confirming each transaction in minutes. Conflux records additional informations between blocks and organizes generated blocks into direct acyclic graphs. The core of Conflux is its consensus protocol that allows multiple participants to contribute to the Conflux blockchain concurrently (i.e., processing transactions in all concurrent blocks) while still being provably safe. See the Conflux project website for more information.\nShrec: Shrec is a novel transaction relay protocol for high-throughput blockchain systems built around a hybrid transaction hashing scheme that has a low hash collision rate, is resilient to collision attacks, and is fast to construct. Shrec reduces the bandwidth consumption by 60% at modest CPU overhead and improves the system throughput by up to 90%.\nGosig: Gosig is a scalable Byzantine consensus protocol for consortium blockchains. Gosig uses transmission pipelining to fully utilize the network bandwidth and uses aggregated signature gossip to reduce the number of messages. It can scale up to 5000 nodes while still maintaining the throughput of 3000 transactions per second.\nSmart Contract Security\nSmart contract is a program that encodes a set of transaction rules. Once deployed to a blockchain, its encoded rules are enforced by all participants of the blockchain network, and therefore it eliminates counterparty risks in sophisticated transactions. Unfortunately, like other programs, smart contracts may contain errors. Errors inside smart contracts often lead to significant financial losses in the real world.\nSolythesis: Solythesis is a source-to-source runtime validation tool for Solidity. Its design is based on the observation that smart contract execution is not the performance bottleneck of blockchain systems. The overhead of runtime validation, which is often too expensive for other domains, is in fact negligible for smart contracts.\nAutomatic Patch Generation\nSoftware defects are pervasive in software systems and can cause undesirable user experience, denial of service, or even security exploitation. Generating a patch for a defect is a tedious, time-consuming, and often repetitive process. Automatic patch generation techniques holds out the promise of automatically correcting software defects without the need for human developers to diagnose, understand, and correct these defects. To learn more, please visit our project website!\nProphet: Prophet is the state-of-art generate-and-validate patch generation system for C programs. It is the first system that uses machine learning techniques to learn from past successful human patches to recognize and predict correct patches for new errors.\nSPR: SPR is the baseline system on which Prophet is built. It uses the condition synthesis technique to explore its search space up to two magnitude faster.\nCodePhage: CodePhage systematically transfers useful security checks from a donor application to eliminate bugs and security vulnerabilities in a recipient application. It is the first system that transfers useful code across applications. It does not even require the source code of the donor application!\nInput Filtering and Rectification\nWhat if we cannot change the source code of an application? Let's look at the inputs of the application. We can make sure that malicious input cannot reach the application, i.e., filter them or rectify them.\nSIFT: SIFT is a sound input filter system with sophisticated program analysis techniques. It guarantees to filter out all malicious inputs that trigger critical integer overflow errors. In practice, it also has zero to negligible false positives.\nSOAP: SOAP is the first automatic input rectification system. It enforces a set of inferred invariants on the inputs so that potentially malicious inputs are transformed to benign inputs.\nProgram Recovery\nWhat if an application crashes during its execution and we only have its binary? We can use our recovery shepherding technique to enable the application to survive the error triggering input unit and recovers its execution.\nRCV: RCV is a lightweight program recovery tool with negligible overhead during normal execution. When a crash error (null-dereference and/or divide-by-zero) occurs, it systematically guides the application execution to survive the error triggering input unit. It also tracks how the error propagates in the application and waits until the error is flushed away after the program moves to the next input unit. Instead of crash and getting nothing, you can get part or all of your desired results.\nPublications\nUtilizing Parallelism in Smart Contracts on Decentralized Blockchains by Taming Application-Inherent Conflicts [pdf]\nPeter Garamvolgyi, Yuxi Liu, Dong Zhou, Fan Long, Ming Wu\nICSE 2022\nAutomatic Horizontal Fusion for GPU Kernels [pdf]\nAo Li, Bojian Zhang, Gennady Pekhimenko, Fan Long\nCGO 2022\nLMPTs: Eliminating Storage Bottlenecks for Processing Blockchain Transactions [pdf]\nJemin Andrew Choi, Sidi Mohamed Beillahi, Peilun Li, Andreas Veneris, Fan Long\nIEEE ICBC 2022 (best paper)\nAutomated Auditing of Price Gouging TOD Vulnerabilities in Smart Contracts [pdf]\nSidi Mohamed Beillahi, Eric Keilty, Keerthi Nelaturu, Andreas Veneris, Fan Long\nIEEE ICBC 2022\nPipeZK: Accelerating Zero-Knowledge Proof with a Pipelined Architecture [pdf]\nYe Zhang, Shuo Wang, Xian Zhang, Jiangbin Dong, Xingzhong Mao, Fan Long, Cong Wang, Dong Zhou, Mingyu Guo, Guangyu Sun\nISCA 2021\nSmart Contract Refinement for Gas Optimization [pdf]\nKeerthi Nelaturu, Sidi Mohamed Beillahi, Fan Long, Andreas Veneris\nIEEE BRAIN 2021\nShrec: Bandwidth-Efficient Transaction Relay in High-Throughput Blockchain Systems [pdf]\nYilin Han, Chenxing Li, Peilun Li, Ming Wu, Dong Zhou, and Fan Long\nSoCC 2020\nGosig: A Scalable and High-Performance Byzantine Consensus for Consortium Blockchains [pdf]\nPeilun Li, Guosai Wang, Xiaoqi Chen, Fan Long, and Wei Xu\nSoCC 2020\nEngineering Economics in the Conflux Network [pdf]\nYuxi Cai, Fan Long, Andreas Park, and Andreas Veneris\nIEEE BRAIN 2020\nA Decentralized Blockchain with High Throughput and Fast Confirmation [pdf]\nChenxing Li, Peilun Li, Dong Zhou, Zhe Yang, Ming Wu, Guang Yang, Wei Xu, Fan Long, and Andrew Chi-Chih Yao\nUSENIX ATC 2020\nSecuring Smart Contract with Runtime Validation [pdf]\nAo Li, Jemin Andrew Choi, and Fan Long\nPLDI 2020\nAutomatic Patch Generation via Learning from Successful Human Patches [pdf]\nFan Long\nPhD Thesis\nAutomatic Inference of Code Transforms for Patch Generation [pdf slides artifact]\nFan Long, Peter Amidon, and Martin Rinard\nFSE 2017\nCodeCarbonCopy [pdf]\nStelios Sidiroglou-Douskos, Eric Lahtinen, Anthony Eden, Fan Long, and Martin Rinard\nFSE 2017\nAn Analysis of the Search Spaces for Generate and Validate Patch Generation Systems [pdf slides artifact]\nFan Long and Martin Rinard\nICSE 2016\nAutomatic Patch Generation by Learning Correct Code [pdf slides artifact]\nFan Long and Martin Rinard\nPOPL 2016\nControl Jujutsu: On the Weaknesses of Fine-Grained Control Flow Integrity [pdf slides]\nIsaac Evans, Fan Long, Ulziibayar Otgonbaatar, Howard Shrobe, Martin Rinard, Hamed Okhravi, and Stelios Sidiroglou-Douskos\nCCS 2015\nStaged Program Repair with Condition Synthesis [pdf slides artifact]\nFan Long and Martin Rinard\nESEC-FSE 2015\nAn Analysis of Patch Plausibility and Correctness for Generate-And-Validate Patch Generation Systems [pdf artifact]\nZichao Qi, Fan Long, Sara Achour, and Martin Rinard\nISSTA 2015\nAutomatic Error Elimination by Multi-Application Code Transfer [pdf]\nStelios Sidiroglou, Eric Lahtinen, Fan Long, and Martin Rinard\nPLDI 2015\nAutomatic Integer Overflow Discovery Using Goal-Directed Conditional Branch Enforcement [pdf]\nStelios Sidiroglou, Eric Lahtinen, Nathan Rittenhouse, Paolo Piselli, Fan Long, Doekhwan Kim, and Martin Rinard\nASPLOS 2015\nPrincipled Sampling for Anomaly Detection [pdf]\nBrendan Juba, Christopher Musco, Fan Long, Stelios Sidiroglou, and Martin Rinard\nNDSS 2015\nAutomatic Runtime Error Repair and Containment via Recovery Shepherding [ pdf ] [slides]\nFan Long, Stelios Sidiroglou, and Martin Rinard.\nPLDI 2014\nSound Input Filter Generation for Integer Overflow Errors [ pdf slides]\nFan Long, Stelios Sidiroglou, Deokhwan Kim, and Martin Rinard.\nPOPL 2014\nFrom Natural Language Specifications to Program Input Parsers [ pdf ]\nTao Lei, Fan Long, Regina Barzilay, and Martin Rinard.\nACL 2013\nAutomatic Input Rectification [ pdf ]\nFan Long, Vijay Ganesh, Michael Carbin, Stelios Sidiroglou, and Martin Rinard.\nICSE 2012\nG2: A Graph Processing System for Diagnosing Distributed Systems.

This goal is typically framed through the language of statistics, and solved using algorithms for probabilistic inference or optimization.\nRepresentation learning How we represent data affects how effectively we process and understand it. I am interested in learning useful and robust representations, with a particular interest in techniques that learn representations from pretext tasks. In recent work, we showed how to learn compressed representations of data with performance guarantees on a large, possibly infinite, set of downstream tasks.\nLearning with discrete structure I am also motivated by applications to reasoning about data with discrete structure, such as integer programming or discrete reasoning tasks. Together with colleagues, we built the first artificial agent that plays the board game Go at a superhuman level, developed structured models of human-written source code, and designed relaxed gradient estimators for models with structured latent variables.\nInference and optimization Algorithms for Bayesian inference and optimization are the engines that drive machine learning. Although these two problems seem distinct, they have a lot of shared structure. I am interested in this interplay: we showed how to simulate from a probability distribution by optimizing a random function and how the use of a kinetic energy can condition optimization.\nGroup\nProspective members If you are an undergraduate at UofT, please use this application form.

   "text": "Main\nResearch\nCourses\nAleksandar Nikolov\nAssociate Professor, Department of Computer Science, University of Toronto\nCanada Research Chair in Algorithms and Private Data Analysis\nAbout me\nI am broadly interested in theoretical computer science, and algorithm design, and I am a member of the Theory Group. I am also an affiliate at the Vector Institute, and a faculty fellow at the Schwartz Reisman Institute. My current research interests are in the connections between high dimensional geometry and computer science. In my work, I have applied geometric tools to the theory of private data analysis (differential privacy), discrepancy theory, and experimental design. I have also worked on computational questions in high dimensions, such as nearest neighbour search, and various geometric optimization problems. I also think about approximation algorithms, and sublinear and parallel algorithms for analyzing massive data. For more information, look in Research. If any of the above sounds intriguing, and you are a talented and motivated student interested in the theory of computing and the design of algorithms, I encourage you to apply to the University of Toronto.\nBefore coming to Toronto, between October 2014 and July 2015, I was a postdoc researcher in the Theory Group at Microsoft Research in Redmond. Before that, I completed my PhD in Rutgers University's Computer Science department, where I was advised by Muthu. During 2012-2014 I was supported by a Simons Graduate Fellowship.\nOn the more personal side: I was born in Varna, Bulgaria, right on the Black Sea coast. On my mother's side I come from a family of Banat Bulgarians. I first moved to North America to study in St. Peter's College (now University): a small Jesuit college in Jersey City. If you want to be especially friendly, and follow Slavic people's proud tradition of having arbitrary nicknames, you can call me Sasho.\nSupervision\nI have supervised the following students:\nSky Li, MSc (current, co-supervised with Azadeh Farzan)\nHaohua Tang, PhD (current)\nLily Li, PhD (current)\nAlexander Edmonds, PhD (current, co-supervised with Toni Pitassi)\nSepehr Abbasi Zadeh, MSc\nAssimakis Kattis, MSc\nI also regularly supervise research projects and independent studies for University of Toronto undergraduate students.\nTeaching\nIn the Winter 2023 term I am teaching CSC473 Advanced Algorithms, and CSC2412 Algorithms for Private Data Analysis.\nIn Fall 2015 I tought a course on discrepancy theory and applications to computer science. You can find the lecture notes here. A more recent but abbreviated set of lecture notes is here.\nFor more information on courses I have taught, see Courses.\nContact information\nOffice: Sandford Fleming 2301B\nEmail: anikolov@cs.toronto.edu\nCurriculum Vitae"

She is also currently serving as associate department chair in the Computer and Mathematical Sciences Department at the University of Toronto, Scarborough. Before joining UofT, she spent 2 years as a post-doc at Carnegie Mellon University working with Garth Gibson. She received her doctorate from the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon University under the direction of Mor Harchol-Balter. She is an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellow, the recipient of the Outstanding Young Canadian Computer Science Prize of the Canadian Association for Computer Science, an Ontario Early Researcher Award, an NSERC Accelerator Award, a two-time winner of the IBM PhD fellowship and her work has won five best paper awards, one best presentation award and two Test of Time Awards. She has served on numerous program committees and has co-chaired the TPCs of Systor 2020, Usenix FAST'14, ACM Sigmetrics'14 and IEEE NAS'11. Her work on the reliability of hard drives, solid state drives and DRAM have been featured in articles at a number of news sites, including Computerworld, Wired, Slashdot, PCWorld, StorageMojo and eWEEK.\nBianca's research focuses on the design, implementation and analysis of computer systems, especially large-scale systems, storage systems and data centers. Her current interests mostly evolve around system reliability and resource allocation, with a focus on applying techniques from data mining, statistics and machine learning to better understand and improve computer systems. Much of her work is done in collaboration with industry partners, currently including Microsoft, Google and NetApp.\nProspective students\nI am recruiting exceptional students interested in joining my group. My group's current projects are in the general areas of resource allocation and scheduling in data centers and reliability of large-scale systems and storage systems. The ideal student is interested in applying analytical techniques from areas like machine learning, data mining, queuing theory, game theory, coding theory, etc., to real-world problems in computer systems and/or also has a keen interest in computer system design and implementation.\nIf you decide to contact me about available positions, please include information on the type of projects you are interested in and why you are considering joining my group. Faculty are receiving a large number of emails from prospective students and if your email does not contain any personalized information it will likely be deleted as spam.\nNews\nFebruary 2022: Our 2008 FAST paper \"An Analysis of Data Corruption in the Storage Stack\" has received the 2021 Test of Time Award!

The USENIX Test of Time Awards recognize papers that have had a lasting impact on their fields.\nCurrent Research\nIn my current work, I am particularly interested in system reliability and resource allocation and scheduling in data centres. A common thread connecting much of my work is that I like to start with measurements in real production systems to characterize the underlying problems in detail. During this process I often make unexpected discoveries, where systems behave/fail differently from what researchers or operators commonly assume. I then use these insights to derive better solutions to problems. In my past work, I have for example measured and analyzed systems at Google, Microsoft, Network Appliances and national laboratories, such as Los Alamos National Lab.\nPublications\nThe list below is unfortunately very much out of date.

I am also a Research Lead at the Schwartz Reisman Institute for Technology and Society and a Faculty Affiliate of the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence.\nAbout My Research\nMy research is on developing theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence (AI) systems. By leveraging insights from computer science, economics, political science, philosophy, and cognitive psychology, I uncover how to design AI systems that aggregate individual preferences to make collective decisions (social choice theory), how self-interested agents behave in such systems (game theory), and how to design robust AI systems in the presence of strategic agents (mechanism design).\nMy recent work has focused extensively on the issue of algorithmic fairness in AI systems. Using multidisciplinary insights, my work has proposed robust fairness definitions that meaningfully and non-trivially apply to a broad range of decision-making settings from voting and resource allocation, to conference peer reviewing and recommender systems, to classification and clustering.\nI co-developed two not-for-profit websites, Spliddit.org (currently under maintenance) and RoboVote.org (now defunct), which have helped more than 250,000 people make provably fair and efficient decisions in their everyday lives.\nCheck out my publications."

I am part of the Robotics Group at the Department of Computer Science. My research centers around robotics and spans machine learning, perception, planning and control. My group and I develop methods that enable robots to perceive, reason, and act effectively and safely, particularly in dynamic environments and alongside humans. I want to enable people to effectively specify the desired task and behavior of their robots, without requiring them to write code. I also strive to provide safety guarantees during the robot learning process and beyond, during deployment. Application areas of my research include field robotics for environmental monitoring, visual navigation for autonomous vehicles, and mobile manipulation. I am interested in the following topics:\nAutonomous robots for environmental monitoring and scientific exploration\nLearning visual attention operators for exploration and navigation\nActive sensing and information gathering\nInformed visual search\nVisual navigation\nVideo and sensor data summarization\nField robotics\nMachine learning for planning and control\nImitation learning\nInverse reinforcement learning\nPlanning and control under uncertainty\nLearning-based task and motion planning\nDifferentiable physics and rendering simulators\nLikelihood-free inference\nContinual learning\nShared autonomy\nSafety guarantees during robot learning and deployment\nSafe exploration in reinforcement learning\nPhysically-realizable adversarial simulation scenarios\nDifferentiable sensor simulation\nRare event generation\nRisk estimation\nOne of the applications of my research has been to enable environmental monitoring by robots that autonomously operate in the field and collect useful data for environmental scientists. Human-robot collaboration, learning from a few demonstrations, and robust navigation in 3D are critical in these outdoor domains. I have also worked on vision-based simultaneous mapping, localization, and navigation for ground, aerial, and underwater robots. Another application has been in automatically generating simulation environments for self-driving cars, which in many cases today is done semi-manually and in ways that do not facilitate optimization in high dimensions.\nI am looking for postdocs, PhD, MSc, and undergraduate students with computer science or engineering backgrounds.

Over the past decade our research has produced a number of notable systems ilovesketch, meshmixer, crossshade, true2form, neobarok, flatfab, and cassie.\nInteractive Character Animation (INCA)\nCharacter setup leaves an animator unencumbered, like a puppeteer, to focus on the formidable task of bringing a character to life. I designed and developed character and facial animation tools for Maya 1.0, and animated films of long time collaborator Chris Landreth. I focus is on the most expressive parts of our anatomy: face and hands. Our start-up JALI Research has been used to drive the facial animation in Cyberpunk 2077 and other AAA games. At Weta Digital, we developed a new digital representation for the face based on its musculoskeletal anatomy, for the VFX Oscar winning film Avatar: the way of water.\nMathematical Surface Representations for Conceptual Design\nFrom 2003-2012 (the duration of the MITACS NCE), I led a project on the mathematics of shape representation that produced over 100 publications, numerous best paper and technology transfer awards.\nArtistic Projection and Rendering\nMy interest in this area is to use non-photo realism as a tool for self-expression, as a visual manifestation of Nin's observation\n\"we dont see things as they are, we see them as we are\".\nTranscendent Reality\nIn 1994 I was fortunate to work on the first virtual space tele-conferencing system (left) at ATR during my PhD in 1994. My interests in AR/VR today go beyond an augmented world, to one where reality is subtracted, transformed, or more generally transcended.

I take a highly multidisciplinary approach integrating computational theories and techniques with insights from the fields of linguistics and psycholinguistics. Most of my work is in cognitive science, developing computational cognitive models of how people learn and process language, with a focus on meaning (especially word-level semantics, and pragmatics). My work in CL involves machine learning of semantic and syntactic information from text data, showing how linguistic knowledge or cognitive principles can help guide the learning process."

   "name": "Nandita Vijaykumar\nAssistant Professor",
   "text": "Nandita Vijaykumar\nAssistant Professor, University of Toronto\nembARC Research Group\nHomepage\nAbout\nPublications\nResearch Group\nContact\nAbout\nI am an assistant professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Toronto and the Department of Computer and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Toronto Scarborough. I am also affiliated with the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. I lead the embARC Research Group.\nBefore joining the University of Toronto, I was a research scientist in the Memory Architecture and Accelerator Lab at Intel Labs. I received my Ph.D. and M.S. in 2019 from Carnegie Mellon University where I was advised by Prof. Onur Mutlu and Prof. Phil Gibbons. I was fortunate to also work with the Systems Group in the Computer Science Department at ETH Zurich as a visiting student. In the past, I have also worked for AMD, Intel, Microsoft, and Nvidia.\nMy research interests lie in the general area of computer architecture, compilers, and systems with a focus on the interaction between programming models, systems, and architectures. My current interests are in the system-level and programming challenges of robotics and large-scale machine learning.\nMy dissertation research focused on enabling practical cross-layer approaches to system design. This involves rethinking the abstractions and interfaces with which the programming model, system, and the hardware architecture interact. With diminishing returns from traditional architectural innovation, cross-layer approaches are increasingly important to push forward the boundary of energy efficiency and performance, and solve hard problems in security, reliablity, and quality-of-service that will require full-stack approaches.\nIn my thesis research, I developed rich, yet practical, cross-layer abstractions that bridge the semantic gap between the application and system/hardware to open up a new space of cross-layer optimizations that enhance performance, productivity, and portability. Beyond my thesis research, I have also worked on memory systems, GPUs, and systems for efficient machine learning.\nI am currently looking to take new graduate students. Please apply directly to the graduate program at the Department of Computer Science.

Innovations in A/B Experimentation and interfaces to LLMs.\nOne example of our work is to transform ubiquitous explanations and prompting questions (e.g. text in a webpage, email, SMS) into an Intelligent Adaptive Intervention. We do this by innovating in uses of A/B experimentation, like inventing the MOOClet toolkit that enhances & personalizes explanations/prompts by A/B testing alternative versions that are generated by human & artificial intelligence (coordinating contributions from designers, social-behavioural scientists, users, chatGPT-like systems), and using adaptive experiments that automatically analyze data and use it to give better versions to future users. Our adaptive experiments apply and advance machine learning algorithms and statistical tests.\nOur papers (www.intadaptint.org/papers) span publications in HCI (Human Computer Interaction), applied Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence, Statistics, Cognitive/Social/Clinical Psychology, Digital Education, Mental Health, and other areas.\nJoseph Jay Williams directs the Intelligent Adaptive Interventions lab, as an Assistant Professor in Computer Science (8 Grad Students), with courtesy appointments in Psychology (2 Grad Students) and Statistics (2 Grad Students), as well as Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, Economics, and the Vector Institute for Artificial Intelligence. More information on lab members is at www.intadaptint.org/people, and about Joseph at his CV (https://www.josephjaywilliams.com/additional-information/academic-cv).\nWe've published papers on technology for education, learning, and mental health, by testing competing ideas about how to design components of online homework, apps, text messaging interventions, and other interface components.\nJoseph's TEDxPortofSpain talk explains how we use this approach in education, using MOOClets to intelligently adapt explanations for how to solve math problems.\nFor more information, check out our Lab Vision page.\nLatest News\n#Highlights\nIAI Lab named finalists in the XPRIZE Digital Learning Challenge!\n#Awards & ShoutOuts\nOur QuickTA project combining AI (RL algorithms & #LLMs) with @TutorGen is one of 16 #ToolsCompetition finalists for the DARPA AI Tools for Adult Learning opportunity!\n#Recent Accepted Publications\nTwo papers accepted to CHI' 23.

   "text": "Home\nResearch\nPublications\nTeaching\nActivities\nQizhen Zhang\nI am an incoming Assistant Professor in Computer Science at the University of Toronto starting Fall 2023. I am broadly interested in data management and computer systems. My research has been bridging cloud data processing systems and data center networks to address emerging challenges in hyperscale data processing.\nBefore joining UofT, I am spending a year in industry at Microsoft Research, Redmond as a post-doc researcher in the data systems group.\nEmail, CV, Google Scholar, LinkedIn, Twitter\nI am actively looking for students to work on cloud data systems, data center networking, and interactions between ML and systems. If you are interested, please apply to UofT CS and mention my name. Feel free to drop me an email.\nNews\nMay 2023Cowbird is accepted at SIGCOMM 2023\nMar. 2023I will teach memory-disaggregated DBMSs at SIGMOD 2023\nOct. 2022TeShu is accepted at CIDR 2023\nAug. 2022I am now at Microsoft Research\nAug. 2022FlexChain is accepted at VLDB 2023\nOlder News\nResearch\nToday's largest data processing workloads are hosted in cloud data centers. Due to unprecedented data growth, these workloads have ballooned to hyperscale level, encompassing billions to trillions of data items and hundreds to thousands of machines per query. Enabling and expanding with these workloads are highly scalable data center networks that connect up to hundreds of thousands of networked servers. At hyperscale, the classic layered designs are no longer sustainable: without knowing how their data is transferred in the network, applications can make egregious decisions in executions; the cloud infrastructure also performs poorly without rethinking the interfaces and services exposed to its applications. Rather than optimize these massive layers in silos, I build systems across them with principled network-centric designs for efficient hyperscale data processing.\nIn current networks, we design data processing systems by adopting network awareness. Considering data center network characteristics in optimizing distributed operations effectively reduces communication cost at hyperscale. We built GraphRex [SIGMOD '19], the first system that systematically adopts network awareness for large-scale graph processing, and a data center network-aware DBMS query optimizer [manuscript under preparation]. We also proposed TeShu [CIDR '23], a shuffle layer that encompasses network-aware optimizations and offers them to a variety of distributed data processing systems with templates.\nFor future networks, we improve the interfaces and services that the cloud infrastructure offers to applications and codesign data processing systems to achieve optimal performance. In particular, we have been pioneering the work on data processing in disaggregated data centers (DDCs), a promising new cloud proposal. We opened the topic by rethinking data processing system designs in DDCs [CIDR '20] and, for the first time, investigated the effect of DDCs on production systems [VLDB '20], which opened a broad space of research opportunities. We proposed TELEPORT [SIGMOD '22], a novel compute pushdown feature of DDCs for efficient data processing. To realize DDC benefits in today’s clouds, I developed Redy [VLDB '22] with industry, and more recently, we applied disaggregated designs to improve resource efficiency for blockchain workloads with FlexChain [VLDB '23].\nTo facilitate network innovation, we must evaluate the performance of network proposals at scale. This, however, is intractable because of network size and complexity. To support our work and that of others, we developed MimicNet [SIGCOMM '21], the first scalable system that provides accurate performance estimates for data center networks. It models network behavior in FatTree topologies with machine learning. To generalize this approach, we proposed a machine learning platform [manuscript under preparation] to present network modeling as a learning challenge problem.\nI have also worked on other aspects of data processing, including data science application with machine learning [CIKM '17], data processing cost efficiency [SoCC '17], and fault-tolerant computing [manuscript under preparation]. Recently, I proposed CompuCache [CIDR '22], a new cloud service that exploits spot VMs for remote caching and memory-intensive compute offloading.\nPublications\nCowbird: Freeing CPUs to Compute by Offloading the Disaggregation of Memory\nXinyi Chen, Liangcheng Yu, Vincent Liu, Qizhen Zhang\nAnnual Conference of the ACM Special Interest Group on Data Communication, SIGCOMM 2023, to appear\nDisaggregated Database Systems\nJianguo Wang, Qizhen Zhang\nACM International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD 2023 Tutorial\nFlexChain: An Elastic Disaggregated Blockchain\nChenyuan Wu, Mohammad Javad Amiri, Jared Asch, Heena Nagda, Qizhen Zhang, Boon Thau Loo\nInternational Conference on Very Large Data Bases, VLDB 2023\nTemplating Shuffles\nQizhen Zhang, Jiacheng Wu, Ang Chen, Vincent Liu, Boon Thau Loo\nConference on Innovative Data Systems Research, CIDR 2023\nOptimizing Data-intensive Systems in Disaggregated Data Centers with TELEPORT\nQizhen Zhang, Xinyi Chen, Sidharth Sankhe, Zhilei Zheng, Ke Zhong, Sebastian Angel, Ang Chen, Vincent Liu, Boon Thau Loo\nACM International Conference on Management of Data, SIGMOD 2022\nRedy: Remote Dynamic Memory Cache\nQizhen Zhang, Philip Bernstein, Daniel Berger, Badrish Chandramouli\nInternational Conference on Very Large Data Bases, VLDB 2022\nCompuCache: Remote Computable Caching using Spot VMs\nQizhen Zhang, Philip Bernstein, Daniel Berger, Badrish Chandramouli, Vincent Liu, Boon Thau Loo\nConference on Innovative Data Systems Research, CIDR 2022\nMimicNet: Fast Performance Estimates for Data Center Networks with Machine Learning\nQizhen Zhang, Kelvin K.W.
